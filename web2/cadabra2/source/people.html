  listed below.
</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>
Special thanks to José M. Martín-García (for the xPerm
canonicalisation code), James Allen (for writing much of the original
factoring code), Dominic Price (for the conversion to pybind, the
Windows port and the logic that enables importing notebooks into other
notebooks), Connor Behan (for patches to improve trace operators and
various other parts), Fergus Baker (for the new Jupyter kernel), Leo
Brewin (for writing beautiful tutorials), Mattia Scomparin (for
contributing tutorial notebooks) the Software Sustainability Institute
and the Institute of Advanced Study (for financial support). Thanks to
the many people who have sent me bug reports (keep 'm coming), and
thanks to all of you who use Cadabra, sent feedback or cited the
Cadabra papers.
</p>
<p>
  The name Cadabra is an implicit acknowledgement to
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mees_Roo">Mees de
Roo</a>, who introduced me to his (so far unpublished) Pascal program
<tt>Abra</tt> in the fall of 2000. This program has an extremely
physicist-friendly way of dealing with fermions and tensor symmetries,
and a formula history mechanism still not found in any other
comparable computer algebra system. Cadabra was originally planned to be
``my private C++ version of <tt>Abra</tt>'', and even though it does not
show much similarity anymore, the development was to a large extent
inspired by <tt>Abra</tt>.
