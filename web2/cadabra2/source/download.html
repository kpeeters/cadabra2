<h1>Download and install</h1>

<h2>Build from source (Linux/macOS/Windows)</h2>
<p>
  The source is of Cadabra is distributed via github, see the
  <a href="https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2">kpeeters/cadabra2</a>
  repository for more details, including the pre-requisites.
</p>
<p>
  You can build .deb and .rpm packages yourself when building from
  source, by running <code>sudo cpack</code> after a successful
  build. 
</p>

<h2>Binary packages</h2>
<p>
  Packages for various Linux distributions and an installer for
  Windows are available
  for <a href="https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2/releases/latest">download
  from github</a>. These are generated automatically on every
  release. Installation on macOS can be done through HomeBrew or
  MacPorts; see below. There is also a Docker image if you only want
  to use Cadabra via Jupyter.
</p>
<p>
  Use these packages at your own risk. Because of time constraints
  some of these packages receive almost no testing, so any feedback is
  welcome.  If you want to help getting these into official
  distribution repositories, please let me know.

      The AppImage version of Cadabra can be installed on any
      reasonably modern Linux distribution and it is completely
      self-contained (which is inefficient, so prefer a distro package
      below if there is one for your system). Just download and make
      the file executable with <tt>chmod u+x *.AppImage</tt>. Versions
      are provided for
      <tt>x86_64</tt> and <tt>aarch64</tt> architectures from

    seems to be mostly functional, including plotting. Download

    installer from the github release page</a> (available for x86_64
    right now only). All batteries are included so you do not need to
