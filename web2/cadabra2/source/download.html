<h1>Download and install</h1>

<h2>Build from source (Linux/macOS/Windows)</h2>
<p>
  The source is of Cadabra is distributed via github, see the
  <a href="https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2">kpeeters/cadabra2</a>
  repository for more details, including the pre-requisites.
</p>
<p>
  You can build .deb and .rpm packages yourself when building from
  source, by running <code>sudo cpack</code> after a successful
  build. 
</p>

<h2>Binary packages</h2>
<p>
  Packages for various Linux distributions are available
  for <a href="https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2/releases/latest">download
  from github</a>. These are generated automatically on every
  release. Installation on macOS can be done through HomeBrew or
  MacPorts; see below. There is also a Docker image if you only want
  to use Cadabra via Jupyter.
</p>
<p>
  Use these packages at your own risk. Because of time constraints
  some of these packages receive almost no testing, so any feedback is
  welcome.  If you want to help getting these into official
  distribution repositories, please let me know.

    A Windows installer for Cadabra is finally available again. There
    are some rough edges that still need to be fine-tuned, but it
    seems to be mostly functional, including plotting. Download

    installer (x86_64) from the github release page</a>. All batteries
    are included so you do not need to install anything else. Many

    On Linux and macOS, you can install Cadabra, its native notebook
    interface, and the Jupyter kernel via Conda or Anaconda, thanks
    to the work of Isuru Fernando. Activate the <tt>conda-forge</tt>
    channel if you have not done that already, with
    <code>conda config --add channels conda-forge</code>
    <code>conda config --set channel_priority strict</code>
    and then install these packages by using one of the following
    lines:
    <code>conda install cadabra2</code>
    <code>conda install cadabra2-gtk</code>
    <code>conda install cadabra2-jupyter-kernel</code>
