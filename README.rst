*A field-theory motivated approach to computer algebra.*

This repository holds the 2.x series of the Cadabra computer
algebra system. It is slowly getting ready for public consumption, but
expect some rough edges.

Cadabra was designed specifically for the solution of problems
encountered in quantum and classical field theory. It has extensive
functionality for tensor computer algebra, tensor polynomial
simplification including multi-term symmetries, fermions and
anti-commuting variables, Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations,
implicit coordinate dependence, multiple index types and many
more. The input format is a subset of TeX. Both a command-line and a
graphical interface are available.

Prerequisites
-------------

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Debian/Ubuntu you can install all that is needed with::

    sudo apt-get install cmake python3-dev g++ libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libgmp3-dev
    sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-3.0-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev
    sudo apt-get install python-sympy libsqlite3-dev uuid-dev
    sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra python3-matplotlib python3-mpmath dvipng

The configuration script will warn you if dependencies are missing.
To build the documentation locally, you need::

    sudo apt-get install doxygen libjs-mathjax

This is the development platform and issues are typically first fixed
here. You can use either g++ or the clang++ compiler.


Linux (Fedora/CentOS/Scientific Linux)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Fedora/CentOS/Scientific Linux you can install the dependencies with::

    sudo yum install cmake gcc-c++ python-devel pcre-devel gmp-devel
    sudo yum install libuuid-devel sqlite-devel
    sudo yum install gtkmm30-devel boost-devel
    sudo yum install texlive python3-matplotlib

This platform receives less testing so please get in touch if you run
into any issues. You can use either g++ or the clang++ compiler.


Linux (Arch/Manjaro/Arch Derivatives)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Arch/Manjaro/Arch Derivative Linux you can install the dependencies by using an automated build
program such as ``yaourt`` or by specifying the ``-s`` flag with ``makepkg``.

This platform receives less testing so please get in touch if you run
into any issues. You can use either g++ or the clang++ compiler.


OS X
~~~~

Cadabra builds with the standard Apple compiler, but in order to
build on OS X you need a number of packages from Homebrew (see
http://brew.sh).  Install these packages with::

    brew install cmake boost pcre gmp python3
    brew uninstall boost-python
	  brew install boost-python --with-python3
    brew install pkgconfig ossp-uuid
    brew install gtkmm3 adwaita-icon-theme

The uninstall of boost-python in the 2nd line is to ensure that you
have a version with python3 support. If the lines above prompt you to
install XCode, go ahead and let it do that.

You also need a TeX installation such as MacTeX,
http://tug.org/mactex/ .  *Any* TeX will do, as long as 'latex' and
'dvipng' are available. Make sure to *install TeX* before attempting
to build Cadabra, otherwise the Cadabra style files will not be
installed in the appropriate place. Make sure 'latex' works from the
terminal in which you will build Cadabra.

With the above packages, you will build the Gtk interface for Cadabra.
I am still planning a native OS X interface, but because building the
Gtk interface is so easy and the result looks relatively decent, this
may take a while (definitely until after 2.0 has been released).

Feedback from OS X users is *very* welcome because this is not my main
development platform.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

Once you have the required prerequisites installed, you can build
Cadabra, on all supported platforms, using the standard::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This will build all binaries relevant for your platform. You will get
warned when dependencies are missing. Use::

    sudo make install

to install the software. The notebook interface is started with::

    cadabra-gtk

while the command-line version is called::

    cadabra2


Installation instructions for Arch/Manjaro/Arch Derivatives
-----------------------------------------------------------

The development package for Arch Linux is `cadabra2-git <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cadabra2-git/>`.
Building and installing (including dependencies) can be accomplished with a front end to ``pacman`` such as
``yaourt`` with::

    yaourt -Sy cadabra2-git

This can be done using manually using ``makepkg`` with::

    curl -L -O https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/cadabra2-git.tar.gz
    tar -xvf cadabra2-git.tar.gz
    cd cadabra2-git
    makepkg -sri

For more information regarding building on Arch Linux see the `Arch Wiki <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages>`.
