This repository holds the 2.x series of the Cadabra computer algebra
system. It supersedes the 1.x series, which can still be found at
http://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra.

Cadabra was designed specifically for the solution of problems
encountered in quantum and classical field theory. It has extensive
functionality for tensor computer algebra, tensor polynomial
simplification including multi-term symmetries, fermions and
anti-commuting variables, Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations,
implicit coordinate dependence, multiple index types and many
more. The input format is a subset of TeX. Both a command-line and a
graphical interface are available.

Installation
-------------

Cadabra builds on Linux and Mac OS X, and might soon build on Windows
too. Select your system from the list below

- `Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)`_
- `Linux (Fedora 24 and later)`_
- `Linux (older Fedora/CentOS/Scientific Linux)`_
- `Linux (OpenSUSE)`_
- `Linux (Arch/Manjaro)`_
- `Linux (Solus)`_
- `Mac OS X`_
- `Windows`_

Binaries for these platforms may (or may not) be provided from the
download page at http://cadabra.science/download.html, but they are
not always very up-to-date.

See `Building Cadabra as C++ library`_ for instructions on how to
build the entire Cadabra functionality as a library which you can use
in a C++ program.


Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Debian/Ubuntu you can install all that is needed with::

    sudo apt install cmake python3-dev g++ libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libgmp3-dev \
          libgtkmm-3.0-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev libsqlite3-dev uuid-dev  \
          texlive texlive-latex-extra dvipng \
          python3-matplotlib python3-mpmath python3-pip python3-setuptools
    sudo pip3 install sympy

This is the development platform and issues are typically first fixed
here. You can use either g++ or the clang++ compiler. You need to
clone the cadabra2 git repository (if you download the .zip file you
will not have all data necessary to build). So first do::

    git clone https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2

Building is then done with the standard::

    cd cadabra2
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

This will produce the command line app ``cadabra2`` and the Gtk
notebook interface ``cadabra2-gtk``. You can also find the latter in
the 'Education' menu.

Linux (Fedora 24 and later)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fedora 24 is the first Fedora to have Python 3 by default; for older
Fedora versions see below. This platform receives less testing so
please get in touch if you run into any issues. You can use either g++
or the clang++ compiler.

Install the dependencies with::

    sudo dnf install git python3-devel cmake gcc-c++ \
         pcre-devel gmp-devel libuuid-devel sqlite-devel \
         gtkmm30-devel boost-devel \
         texlive python3-matplotlib \
         python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install sympy

You need to clone the cadabra2 git repository (if you download the
.zip file you will not have all data necessary to build). So first do::

    git clone https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2

Building is then done with the standard::

    cd cadabra2
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

This will produce the command line app ``cadabra2`` and the Gtk
notebook interface ``cadabra2-gtk``. You can also find the latter
when searching for the 'Cadabra' app from the 'Activities' menu.


Linux (older Fedora/CentOS/Scientific Linux)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Fedora/CentOS/Scientific Linux you can install the dependencies with::

    sudo yum install epel-release python-devel cmake gcc-c++ \
             pcre-devel gmp-devel libuuid-devel sqlite-devel \
             gtkmm30-devel boost-devel \
             texlive python-matplotlib

There is no Python 3 by default on this platform, so the instructions
here will build Cadabra for use with Python 2. You also need to
install sympy by hand::

    sudo yum install python-pip
    sudo pip install sympy

This platform receives less testing so please get in touch if you run
into any issues. You can use either g++ or the clang++ compiler. You
need to clone the cadabra2 git repository (if you download the .zip
file you will not have all data necessary to build). So first do::

    git clone https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2

Building is then done with the standard::

    cd cadabra2
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DUSE_PYTHON_3=OFF
    make
    sudo make install

This will produce the command line app ``cadabra2`` and the Gtk
notebook interface ``cadabra2-gtk``. You can also find the latter in
the 'Education' menu.

Linux (OpenSUSE)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For OpenSUSE (tested on 'Leap', probably also fine with minor changes
for 'Tumbleweed') you first need to add the `devel:libraries:c_c++`
repository. To do this, start YaST, go to Software/Software
Repositories/Add/Add by URL.  Use the URL

    http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/libraries:/c_c++/openSUSE_Leap_42.1

After that, dependencies can be installed with::

    sudo zypper install cmake python3-devel gcc-c++ \
                  pcre-devel gmp-devel libuuid-devel sqlite-devel \
                  gtkmm3-devel  \
                  texlive python3-matplotlib \
                  python3-pip \
                  boost_1_61-devel 
    sudo pip3 install sympy

This platform receives less testing so please get in touch if you run
into any issues. You need to clone the cadabra2 git repository (if you
download the .zip file you will not have all data necessary to
build). So first do::

    git clone https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2

Building is then done with the standard::

    cd cadabra2
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. 
    make
    sudo make install

This will produce the command line app ``cadabra2`` and the Gtk
notebook interface ``cadabra2-gtk``. 


Linux (Arch/Manjaro)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The development package for Arch Linux is cadabra2-git
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cadabra2-git/.  Building and
installing (including dependencies) can be accomplished with::

    yaourt -Sy cadabra2-git

Alternatively use ``makepkg``::

    curl -L -O https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/cadabra2-git.tar.gz
    tar -xvf cadabra2-git.tar.gz
    cd cadabra2-git
    makepkg -sri

Please consult the Arch Wiki
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages
for more information regarding installing packages from the AUR.


Linux (Solus)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for Solux Linux is experimental. To build from source on Solus
Linux, first install the dependencies by doing::

    sudo eopkg install -c system.devel
    sudo eopkg install libboost-devel gmp-devel libgtkmm-3-devel 
    sudo eopkg install sqlite3-devel texlive python3-devel
    sudo eopkg install git cmake make g++

Then configure and build with::

    cd cadabra2
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
    make
    sudo make install

This installs below ``/usr`` (instead of ``/usr/local`` on other
platforms) because I could not figure out how to make it pick up
libraries there.

Any feedback on these instructions is welcome.


Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

Cadabra builds with the standard Apple compiler, but in order to build
on OS X you need a number of packages from Homebrew (see
http://brew.sh). Quite a few Homebrew installations have broken
permissions; best to first do::

    sudo chown -R ${USER}:admin /usr/local/

to clean that up. Then install the required dependencies with::

    brew install cmake boost pcre gmp python3 
    brew install pkgconfig 
    brew install gtkmm3 adwaita-icon-theme
    sudo pip3 install sympy

If the lines above prompt you to install XCode, go ahead and let it do
that.

You also need a TeX installation such as MacTeX,
http://tug.org/mactex/ .  *Any* TeX will do, as long as 'latex' and
'dvipng' are available. Make sure to *install TeX* before attempting
to build Cadabra, otherwise the Cadabra style files will not be
installed in the appropriate place. Make sure 'latex' works from the
terminal in which you will build Cadabra.

From 6-Feb-2018 you should be able to build against an Anaconda Python
installation (in case you prefer Anaconda over the Homebrew
Python). If you encounter trouble with this, please let me know.

You need to clone the cadabra2 git repository (if you download the
.zip file you will not have all data necessary to build). So do::

    git clone https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2

After that you can build with the standard::

    cd cadabra2
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

This will produce the command line app ``cadabra2`` and the Gtk
notebook interface ``cadabra2-gtk``. 

I am still planning a native OS X interface, but because building the
Gtk interface is so easy and the result looks relatively decent, this
has been put on hold for the time being.

Feedback from OS X users is *very* welcome because this is not my main
development platform.


Windows
-------

Building on Windows does not work yet completely, but here is
something to get things at least roughly in the right
direction. First, install MSYS2 from http://msys2.github.io. Once you
have a working MSYS2 shell, do the following to install various
packages (all from an MSYS2 shell!)::

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtkmm3
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-boost
    pacman -S gmp gmp-devel pcre-devel
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-sqlite3
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-adwaita-icon-theme

Then close the MSYS2 shell and open the MINGW64 shell. Run::
  
    cd cadabra2/build
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DUSE_PYTHON_3=NO -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/[user] ..
    mingw32-make

Replace '[user]' with your user name.
If the cmake fails with a complaint about 'sh.exe', just run it again.
The above builds for python2, let me know if you know how to make it
pick up python3 on Windows.

This fails to install the shared libraries, but they do get
built. Copy them all in ~/bin, and also copy a whole slew of other
things into there. In addition you need::

    cp /mingw64/bin/gspawn-win* ~/bin
    export PYTHONPATH=/mingw64/lib/python2.7:/home/[user]/bin

This fails to start the server with 'The application has requested the
Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way'.



Tutorials and other help
------------------------

Please consult http://cadabra.science/ for tutorial-style notebooks
and all other documentation, and http://kpeeters.github.io/cadabra2
for doxygen documentation of the current master branch. The latter can
also be generated locally; you will need (on Debian and derivatives)::

    sudo apt-get install doxygen libjs-mathjax  

For any questions, please contact info@cadabra.science .


Building Cadabra as C++ library
-------------------------------

EXPERIMENTAL: If you want to use the functionality of Cadabra inside
your own C++ programs, you can build Cadabra as a shared library. To
do this::

    cd c++lib
	 mkdir build
	 cmake ..
	 make
	 sudo make install

There is a sample program `simple.cc
<https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2/blob/master/c%2B%2Blib/simple.cc>`_
in the `c++lib` directory which shows how to use the Cadabra library.


Special thanks
--------------

Special thanks to José M. Martín-García (for the xPerm
canonicalisation code), James Allen (for writing much of the factoring
code), Dominic Price (for the conversion to pybind), the Software
Sustainability Institute and the Institute of Advanced Study. Thanks
to the many people who have sent me bug reports (keep 'm coming), and
thanks to all of you who cited the Cadabra papers.
